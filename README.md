# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction
Loan Eligibility Prediction assesses whether an applicant is eligible for a loan based on factors like income, credit history, and loan amount. By leveraging machine learning models, this tool helps streamline the loan approval process, making decisions faster and more efficient for both lenders and applicants
Key Factors Considered in Loan Eligibility:
Applicant Income: The primary income of the loan applicant.
Co-applicant Income: Income from any co-applicants (if applicable).
Loan Amount: The amount of loan requested by the applicant.
Loan Term: Duration of the loan repayment period.
Credit History: Whether the applicant has a history of repaying loans on time.
Employment Status: Whether the applicant is employed or self-employed.
Marital Status and Dependents: Personal details that may impact financial stability.
Property Area: Whether the property is in an urban, semi-urban, or rural area.
Machine Learning Approach:
Data Collection: Gather historical loan application data, including the above factors and the loan approval status.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing data, apply transformations like log scaling for highly skewed features (e.g., LoanAmount_log), and standardize or normalize the data.
Feature Engineering: Create new features such as TotalIncome (sum of ApplicantIncome and CoapplicantIncome) and its log transformation to better represent the income distribution.
Model Building: Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.) on the processed data to predict loan eligibility.
Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other metrics.
Objective:
The goal is to create a system that can predict with high accuracy whether a loan applicant is eligible or not, thereby aiding financial institutions in automating and speeding up the loan approval process.

Use Case:
Financial institutions can use loan eligibility prediction models to reduce the manual effort of evaluating loan applications, provide faster decisions, and improve the accuracy of their risk assessment.
